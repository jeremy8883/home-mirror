#  Home Mirror

A smart mirror web application written in elm

Begin by creating `.private/config.json`, and adding:

```
{
  "weather": {
    "darkSkyApiKey": "GET FROM https://darksky.net/dev/",
    "longitude": <float>,
    "latitude": <float>
  }
}

```

To run:
```
npm run start
```
then visit http://localhost:8090 in your browser.

This is a work in progress, so nothing much to see here yet.
